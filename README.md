# Zipkin instrumentation for vue-resource

## What? 

An interceptor for [vue-resource](https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource) that instruments outgoing HTTP requests with [Zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin).

## Why?

Sometimes tracing of your backend components is not enough, so you need to do some tracing on frontend side (part of End User Monitoring). This package helps to solve that problem for [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) with [Zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin).

## How?
